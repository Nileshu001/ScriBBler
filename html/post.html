            Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.[1]
            Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician
            had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application
            of such effects as distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll. While creating
            his unique musical voice and guitar style, Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues,
            R&B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock and roll, psychedelic and jazz.
            Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain.[119] He was instrumental
            in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and helped
            to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock.[348] He rejected the standard
            barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string
            root notes with his thumb.[349] He applied this technique during the beginning bars of "Little Wing",
            which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been
            described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other
            fingers playing melody as a right hand.[350] Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed
            an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more than
            one guitarist was performing.[351][nb 41] He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing
            effects in rock music recordings.[354] Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix pioneered
            the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback
            and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit
            as personal as the blues with which he began."[3][nb 42] Aledort wrote: "In rock guitar, there are but two
            eras ï¿½ before Hendrix and after Hendrix."
